Hello, folks 💕! 

I'm Jasmine, currently a graduate student in Columbia University learning QMSS. I'm passionate about learning quantitative skills to solve real-world problems to make impacts. I found Github is a great place to meet so many talented people and their amazing works. So excited for the new journey here!
